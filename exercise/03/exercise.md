#### Problem 1:

Write a program to print a multiplication table (a times table). At the start, it should ask the user which table to print. The output should look something like this:

 ```
Which multiplication table would you like?
5
Here's your table:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
 ```
 
 #### Problem 2:
 
 Add something else to the multiplication table program. After asking which table the user wants, ask them how high the table should go. The output should look like this:

(note: You can do this with the for-loop version of the program, the while-loop version, or both.)
 
 ```
Which multiplication table would you like?
7
How high do you want to go?
12
Here's your table:
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
7 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
7 x 10 = 70
7 x 11 = 77
7 x 12 = 84
 ```
