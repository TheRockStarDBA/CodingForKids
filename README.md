# CodingForKids

**I am teaching this program every Sat 10 AM EST - FREE of Cost**

This repo contains all the materials that I have used to teach Computer Science (Computational Thinking Concepts and Approaches as well as Coding) to Kids (2nd Grade and up) in USA. I have started this program as an humble effort to teach kids fundamentals and concepts of Computer Science. 

### Why did I chose to teach kids ?
- Teaching Computer Science from an early age has many benefits. 
- The most important reason that I started teaching to kids is - for the longest time, I wanted to teach my son Computer related stuff esp. Programming. 
- When I introduced the facaniting world of programming to my Son at the age of 6 years using [Hello Ruby !](https://www.amazon.com/Hello-Ruby-Adventures-Linda-Liukas/dp/1250065003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1428090470&sr=1-1&keywords=9781250065001) .. what I saw is burning curiosity and eagerness in him to learn new things.
- Then the COVID-19 started and everyone's life was halted and confined between the 4 walls.
- I thought that this is the best time for me to invest time and effort to teach my son - Coding ..esp. Block based programming because it is simple, engaging and helps develop critical thinking skills in kids.
- Then I thought, why just my son should I teach .. why not the kids of my friends ?
- It all started when I posted a message in my friend's group that I am planning to do a "Pilot" program on teaching Kids Computer Science.
- All my friends applauded my idea and now I am teaching a group of 15 kids - from North East region (mainly US, Canada).
