# CodingForKids

**I am teaching this program every Sat 10 AM EST - FREE of Cost**

This repo contains all the materials that I have used to teach Computer Science (Computational Thinking Concepts and Approaches as well as Coding) to Kids (2nd Grade and up) in USA. I have started this program as an humble effort to teach kids fundamentals and concepts of Computer Science. 

### Why did I chose to teach kids ?
- Teaching Computer Science from an early age has many benefits. 
- The most important reason that I started teaching to kids is - for the longest time, I wanted to teach my son Computer related stuff esp. Programming. 
- When I introduced the facaniting world of programming to my Son at the age of 6 years using [Hello Ruby !](https://www.amazon.com/Hello-Ruby-Adventures-Linda-Liukas/dp/1250065003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1428090470&sr=1-1&keywords=9781250065001) .. what I saw is burning curiosity and eagerness in him to learn new things.
- Then the COVID-19 started and everyone's life was halted and confined between the 4 walls.
- I thought that this is the best time for me to invest time and effort to teach my son - Coding ..esp. Block based programming because it is simple, engaging and helps develop critical thinking skills in kids.
- Then I thought, why just my son should I teach .. why not the kids of my friends ?
- It all started when I posted a message in my friend's group that I am planning to do a "Pilot" program on teaching Kids Computer Science.
- All my friends applauded my idea and now I am teaching a group of 15 kids - from North East region (mainly US, Canada).

### Sponsors
Yes, you read it right. With my initiative, there are sponsors that sponsor my small effort of teaching computational thinking and coding (esp in python) to 2nd graders and up. 

A huge THANK YOU from kids and myself to below sponsors :

- [Pybites](https://codechalleng.es/bites/newbie)
  -  They have sponsored their platform for **free** for all the kids that I am teaching. Thank you Bob Belderbos ([@bbelderbos](https://twitter.com/bbelderbos)) and Julian from Pybites!

- [replit.com](https://replit.com/~)
     - This being remote program, kids were struggling with python syntax (esp spacking !). We were using google colab. I wanted a platform that allows sharing just like google docs where the remote person can see what the other person is doing + you can start live thread for the code etc.
     - I reached out to Amjad Masad ([@amasad](https://twitter.com/amasad)) - CEO of replit.com. He was generous enough to offer their [education team suit](https://replit.com/site/teams) for **free**.
